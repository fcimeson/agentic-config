### Added

#### SDK-Based Evaluation Framework
- Complete test execution framework using OpenCode SDK
- Support for openagent and opencoder testing
- Real agent testing with session management
- Smart timeout system with activity monitoring
- Multi-turn conversation support

#### Modular Architecture
- Refactored test-runner.ts (884 lines → 4 focused modules):
  - `test-runner.ts` (411 lines): Thin orchestrator

  - `result-validator.ts` (253 lines): Validation logic
  - `event-logger.ts` (128 lines): Logging utilities

- Enhanced testability through dependency injection

#### Test Infrastructure
- 20+ test cases across multiple categories:
  - OpenAgent: Developer (12), Context Loading (5), Business (2), Edge Cases (3)
  - OpenCoder: Developer (4)
- BehaviorEvaluator for validating expected agent actions
- Comprehensive evaluators: approval-gate, context-loading, delegation, tool-usage

#### Interactive Results Dashboard
- Real-time test results visualization
- Filtering by agent, category, status
- Detailed violation tracking
- CSV export functionality
- Historical results tracking
- One-command deployment (`./serve.sh`)

#### Documentation

  - `scripts/utils/`: Utility scripts (2 files)
- Comprehensive scripts/README.md with usage examples

#### Monorepo Structure
- Root package.json with convenient npm scripts
- Easy agent selection (openagent, opencoder)
- Easy model selection (grok, claude, gpt-4)
- Quick dashboard access from root
- No folder navigation required

#### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Pre-merge validation for agent changes
- Fast smoke tests for both agents
- Automated test result reporting

#### Agent Improvements

- New opencoder agent with test suite
- Improved subagent invocation patterns
- Ultra-compact context index system

### Changed
- Reorganized evaluation framework structure
- Improved test case schema with behavior expectations
- Enhanced context loading detection

### Removed
- Outdated documentation files (TESTING_CONFIDENCE.md, TEST_REVIEW.md, SESSION_STORAGE_FIX.md)
- Redundant test files

### Fixed
